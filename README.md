## Description
This program solves a specified differential equation with its boundary conditions using the Finite Element Method (FEM).
It's an assignment from the Differential Equations course at AGH University of Krakow.

A detailed description (in Polish) is available in the *notes.pdf* document (with its LaTeX source file *notes.tex*).

## Prerequisites
The following are required to run the program:
+ Python 3.12.3
